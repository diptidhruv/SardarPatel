            Kheda district who were unable to pay the high taxes levied by the
            British due to crop failure and a plague epidemic. Sardar Patel and
            a group of Mahatma Gandhi’s supporters organised a major tax revolt,
            and all the different ethnic and caste communities of Kheda rallied
            around it. The peasants of Kheda signed a petition calling for the
            tax for that year to be scrapped, in the wake of a famine. The
            Government first retaliated by rejecting the charter and
            confiscating properties, but finally relented for an honourable
            agreement for both parties. The tax for the year in question and the
            next would be suspended and the increase in rate reduced while all
            confiscated property would be returned. The victory was celebrated
            in Nadiad.

            on Jan 10, 1921. It was installed in 1929 after Sardar Patel left

            Patel never returned to Ahmedabad Municipality in spite of several
            requests. The Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 was led by Vallabhbhai
            Patel and was a classic example of Civil Disobedience Satyagraha and
            revolt in the Indian Independence Movement. It established Sardar
            Patel as one of the main leaders of the Independence Movement. It
            galvanised peasants of Bardoli to protest against arbitrary increase
            in land revenue and launch a Satyagraha. Peasants did not yield to
            coercion even though Government confiscated their land, property,
            crops and cattle. Government had to yield to the demand for
            appointment of an Inquiry Committee to review increased land revenue
            and the protest was thus successful. Vallabhbhai Patel was named as
            Sardar, the leader, in the hearts of people.
